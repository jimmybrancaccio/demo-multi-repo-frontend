# Multi repository Workspaces on Gitpod - Frontend

If your software project is comprised of multiple source control repositories it is possible to configure Gitpod to clone these additional repositories through the configuration keys of `additionalRepositories` and `mainConfiguration` in the [.gitpod.yml](https://www.gitpod.io/docs/references/gitpod-yml) file which removes the need to run multiple workspaces, and makes it easier to configure services which need to be aware of each other.

## Demo

This repository uses `additionalRepositories` to clone the additional repository of https://github.com/gitpod-io/demo-multi-repo-backend into `/workspaces/backend` which removes the need to run multiple Gitpod workspaces, and makes it easier to configure services which need to be aware of each other.
